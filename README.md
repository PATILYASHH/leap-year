# Leap Year Checker

This is a simple C program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: Compile the program using a C compiler. For example, if you're using gcc, you can compile it with the command:
    ```
    gcc leap_year_checker.c -o leap_year_checker
    ```
2. **Run**: Run the compiled program and follow the instructions to enter a year.
    ```
    ./leap_year_checker
    ```
3. **Input**: Enter a year when prompted.

4. **Output**: The program will then output whether the entered year is a leap year or not.

## Logic

The program checks whether the input year is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless it's also divisible by 400. This logic follows the rules for determining leap years.

## Example

Enter Your Year : 2024

2024 is a Leap Year
